## Changelog

* [CHANGE] Multierror: Implement `Unwrap() []error`. This allows to use `multierror.MultiError` with both `errors.Is()` and `errors.As()`. Previously implemented `Is(error) bool` has been removed. #522
* [CHANGE] Add a new `grpc_server_recv_buffer_pools_enabled` option that enables recv buffer pools in the gRPC server (assuming `grpc_server_stats_tracking_enabled` is disabled). #510
* [CHANGE] Add a new `grpc_server_stats_tracking_enabled` option that allows us to disable stats tracking and potentially improve server memory reuse. #507
* [CHANGE] Add support for PROXY protocol to Server. #508
* [CHANGE] Add a new middleware to cancel http requests cleanly based on http.TimeoutHandler. #504
* [CHANGE] Exemplar label changes from "traceID" to "trace_id". #487
* [CHANGE] server: import godeltaprof/http/pprof adding /debug/pprof/delta_{heap,mutex,block} endpoints to DefaultServeMux #450
* [CHANGE] Move httpgrpc request & response utils up from httpgrpc/server to httpgrpc package #434, #435
* [CHANGE] Updated the minimum required Go version to 1.20 and update Drone config #420
* [CHANGE] Change `WaitRingStability` and `WaitInstanceState` methods signature to rely on `ReadRing` instead. #251

  * `-memberlist.advertise_addr`
  * `-memberlist.advertise_port`
* [CHANGE] Removed global metrics for KV package. Making a KV object will now require a prometheus registerer that will be used to register all relevant KV class metrics. #22
* [CHANGE] Added CHANGELOG.md and Pull Request template to reference the changelog
* [CHANGE] Remove `cortex_` prefix for metrics registered in the ring. #46
* [CHANGE] Rename `kv/kvtls` to `crypto/tls`. #39

* [CHANGE] Lifecycler: Default value of lifecycler's `final-sleep` is now `0s` (i.e. no sleep). #121
* [CHANGE] Minor cosmetic changes in ring and memberlist HTTP status templates. #149
* [CHANGE] flagext.Secret: `value` field is no longer exported. Value can be read using `String()` method and set using `Set` method. #154
* [CHANGE] spanlogger.SpanLogger: Log the user ID from the context with the `user` label instead of `org_id`. #156
* [CHANGE] ring: removed the following metrics from ring client and lifecycler: #161
  * `member_ring_tokens_owned`
  * `member_ring_tokens_to_own`
  * `ring_tokens_owned`
  * `ring_member_ownership_percent`
* [CHANGE] Memberlist: `-memberlist.abort-if-join-fails` option now defaults to false.
* [CHANGE] Remove middleware package. #182
* [CHANGE] Memberlist: disabled TCP-based ping fallback, because dskit already uses a custom transport based on TCP. #194
* [CHANGE] Memberlist: KV store now fast-joins memberlist cluster before serving any KV requests. #195
* [CHANGE] Ring: remove duplicate state in NewOp func #203
* [CHANGE] Memberlist: Increase the leave timeout to 10x the connection timeout, so that we can communicate the leave to at least 1 node, if the first 9 we try to contact times out.
* [CHANGE] Netutil: removed debug log message "found network interfaces with private IP addresses assigned". #216
* [CHANGE] Runtimeconfig: Listener channels created by Manager no longer receive current value on every reload period, but only if any configuration file has changed. #218

* [CHANGE] Memberlist: cluster label verification feature (`-memberlist.cluster-label` and `-memberlist.cluster-label-verification-disabled`) is now marked as stable. #222
* [CHANGE] Cache: Switch Memcached backend to use `github.com/grafana/gomemcache` repository instead of `github.com/bradfitz/gomemcache`. #248
* [CHANGE] Multierror: Implement `Is(error) bool`. This allows to use `multierror.MultiError` with `errors.Is()`. `MultiError` will in turn call `errors.Is()` on every error value. #254
* [CHANGE] Cache: Remove the `context.Context` argument from the `Cache.Store` method and rename the method to `Cache.StoreAsync`. #273
* [CHANGE] ring: make it harder to leak contexts when using `DoUntilQuorum`. #319
* [CHANGE] ring: `CountTokens()`, used for the calculation of ownership in the ring page has been changed in such a way that when zone-awareness is enabled, it calculates the ownership per-zone. Previously zones were not taken into account. #325
* [CHANGE] memberlist: `MetricsRegisterer` field has been removed from `memberlist.KVConfig` in favor of registrerer passed via into `NewKV` function. #327
* [CHANGE] gRPC client: use default connect timeout of 5s, and therefore enable default connect backoff max delay of 5s. #332
* [CHANGE] Remove `github.com/grafana/dskit/errors` in favour of Go's `errors` package. #357
* [CHANGE] Remove `grpcutil.IsGRPCContextCanceled()` in favour of `grpcutil.IsCanceled()`. #357
* [CHANGE] Remove `logrus` and `log.Interface`. #359

* [CHANGE] server: fix incorrect spelling of "gRPC" in `server.Config` fields. #422
* [CHANGE] memberlist: re-resolve `JoinMembers` during full joins to the cluster (either at startup or periodic). The re-resolution happens on every 100 attempted nodes. This helps speed up joins and respect context cancelation #411
* [CHANGE] ring: `ring.DoBatch()` was deprecated in favor of `DoBatchWithOptions()`. #431
* [CHANGE] tenant: Remove `tenant.WithDefaultResolver()` and `SingleResolver` in favor of global functions `tenant.TenantID()`, `tenant.TenantIDs()`,  or `MultiResolver`. #445
* [CHANGE] Cache: Remove legacy metrics from Memcached client that contained `_memcached_` in the name. #461

* [CHANGE] Changed `ShouldLog()` function signature in `middleware.OptionalLogging` interface to `ShouldLog(context.Context) (bool, string)`: the returned `string` contains an optional reason. When reason is valued, `GRPCServerLog` adds `(<reason>)` suffix to the error. #514
* [CHANGE] Cache: Remove superfluous `cache.RemoteCacheClient` interface and unify all caches using the `cache.Cache` interface. #520
* [FEATURE] Cache: Add support for configuring a Redis cache backend. #268 #271 #276

* [FEATURE] Add `middleware.HTTPGRPCTracer` for more detailed server-side tracing spans and tags on `httpgrpc.HTTP/Handle` requests
* [FEATURE] Server: Add support for `GrpcInflightMethodLimiter` -- limiting gRPC requests before reading full request into the memory. This can be used to implement global or method-specific inflight limits for gRPC methods. #377 #392
* [FEATURE] Server: Add `-grpc.server.num-workers` flag that configures the `grpc.NumStreamWorkers()` option. This can be used to start a fixed base amount of workers to process gRPC requests and avoid stack allocation for each call. #400
* [FEATURE] Add `PartitionRing`. The partitions ring is hash ring to shard data between partitions. #474 #476 #478 #479 #481 #483 #484 #485 #488 #489 #493 #496 #497 #498 #503 #509

* [ENHANCEMENT] Memberlist: parallelize processing of messages received by memberlist. #110
* [ENHANCEMENT] flagext: for cases such as `DeprecatedFlag()` that need a logger, add RegisterFlagsWithLogger. #80

* [ENHANCEMENT] ring: Added InstanceRegisterDelegate. #177
* [ENHANCEMENT] ring: optimize shuffle-shard computation when lookback is used, and all instances have registered timestamp within the lookback window. In that case we can immediately return origial ring, because we would select all instances anyway. #181

* [ENHANCEMENT] ring: DoBatch now differentiates between 4xx and 5xx GRPC errors and keeps track of them separately. It only returns when there is a quorum of either error class. If your errors do not implement `GRPCStatus() *Status` from google.golang.org/grpc/status, then this change does not affect you. #201
* [ENHANCEMENT] Added `<prefix>.tls-min-version` and `<prefix>.tls-cipher-suites` flags to client configurations. #217

* [ENHANCEMENT] Lifecycler: Added `InstancesInZoneCount` and `InstancesCount` functions returning respectively the total number of instances in the ring and the number of instances in the ring that are registered in lifecycler's zone, updated during the last heartbeat period. #270
* [ENHANCEMENT] Memcached: add `MinIdleConnectionsHeadroomPercentage` support. It configures the minimum number of idle connections to keep open as a percentage of the number of recently used idle connections. If negative (default), idle connections are kept open indefinitely. #269
* [ENHANCEMENT] Memcached: Add support for using TLS or mTLS with Memcached based caching. #278

* [ENHANCEMENT] Added `TokenGenerator` interface with `RandomTokenGenerator` (generating random tokens), and `SpreadMinimizingTokenGenerator` (generating tokens with almost even distribution) implementation. By default `RandomTokenGenerator` is used. #321
* [ENHANCEMENT] Lifecycler: Added `RingTokenGenerator` configuration that specifies the `TokenGenerator` implementation that is used for token generation. Default value is nil, meaning that `RandomTokenGenerator` is used. #323
* [ENHANCEMENT] BasicLifecycler: Added `RingTokenGenerator` configuration that specifies the `TokenGenerator` implementation that is used for token generation. Default value is nil, meaning that `RandomTokenGenerator` is used. #323
* [ENHANCEMENT] Ring: add support for hedging to `DoUntilQuorum` when request minimization is enabled. #330
* [ENHANCEMENT] Lifecycler: allow instances to register in ascending order of ids in case of spread minimizing token generation strategy. #326
* [ENHANCEMENT] Remove dependency on `github.com/weaveworks/common` package by migrating code to a corresponding package in `github.com/grafana/dskit`. #342
* [ENHANCEMENT] Add ability to pass TLS certificates and keys inline when configuring server-side TLS. #349 #363

* [ENHANCEMENT] Memcached: allow to configure write and read buffer size (in bytes). #414
* [ENHANCEMENT] Server: Add `-server.http-read-header-timeout` option to specify timeout for reading HTTP request header. It defaults to 0, in which case reading of headers can take up to `-server.http-read-timeout`, leaving no time for reading body, if there's any. #423
* [ENHANCEMENT] Make httpgrpc.Server produce non-loggable errors when a header with key `httpgrpc.DoNotLogErrorHeaderKey` and any value is present in the HTTP response. #421
* [ENHANCEMENT] Server: Add `-server.report-grpc-codes-in-instrumentation-label-enabled` CLI flag to specify whether gRPC status codes should be used in `status_code` label of request duration metric. It defaults to false, meaning that gRPC status codes are represented with `error` value. #424 #425
* [ENHANCEMENT] Added `middleware.ReportGRPCStatusOption` that can be passed to the following functions to enable reporting of gRPC status codes in "status_code" label (instead of simplified "error", "cancel" or "success" values): #424
 * `middleware.UnaryServerInstrumentInterceptor`
 * `middleware.StreamServerInstrumentInterceptor`
 * `middleware.UnaryClientInstrumentInterceptor`
 * `middleware.StreamClientInstrumentInterceptor`
 * `middleware.Instrument`
* [ENHANCEMENT] Server: Added new `-server.http-log-closed-connections-without-response-enabled` option to log details about closed connections that received no response. #426
* [ENHANCEMENT] ring: Added new function `DoBatchWithClientError()` that extends an already existing `DoBatch()`. The former differentiates between client and server errors by the filtering function passed as a parameter. This way client and server errors can be tracked separately. The function returns only when there is a quorum of either error class. #427
* [ENHANCEMENT] ring: Replaced `DoBatchWithClientError()` with `DoBatchWithOptions()`, allowing a new option to use a custom `Go(func())` implementation that may use pre-allocated workers instead of spawning a new goroutine for each request. #431
* [ENHANCEMENT] ring: add support for prioritising zones when using `DoUntilQuorum` with request minimisation and zone awareness. #440
* [ENHANCEMENT] ballast: add utility function to allocate heap ballast. #446
* [ENHANCEMENT] ring: use and provide context cancellation causes in `DoUntilQuorum`. #449
* [ENHANCEMENT] ring: `ring.DoBatch` and `ring.DoBatchWithOptions` now check the context cancellation while calculating the replication instances, failing if the context was canceld. #454
* [ENHANCEMENT] Cache: Export Memcached and Redis client types instead of returning the interface, `RemoteCacheClient`, they implement. #453
* [ENHANCEMENT] SpanProfiler: add spanprofiler package. #448
* [ENHANCEMENT] Server: Add support for `ReportHTTP4XXCodesInInstrumentationLabel`, which specifies whether HTTP 4xx status codes should be used in `status_code` label of request duration metric. It defaults to false, meaning that HTTP 4xx status codes are represented with `success` value. Moreover, when `ReportHTTP4XXCodesInInstrumentationLabel` is set to true, responses with HTTP status code `4xx` are returned as errors. #457
* [ENHANCEMENT] Ring: Add `HasReplicationSetChangedWithoutStateOrAddr` to detect replication state changes ignoring IP address changes due to e.g. member restarts. #464
* [ENHANCEMENT] SpanLogger: Add `SetSpanAndLogTag` method. #467
* [ENHANCEMENT] Add servicediscovery package. #469
* [ENHANCEMENT] Expose `InstancesInZoneCount` and `ZonesCount` in `ring.ReadRing` interface. #494
* [ENHANCEMENT] Add optimization to run `concurrency.ForEachJob()` with no parallelism when there's only 1 job. #486 #495
* [ENHANCEMENT] Reduced memory allocations by `user.ExtractFromGRPCRequest()`. #502
* [ENHANCEMENT] Add native histogram version of some metrics: #501
  * `gate_duration_seconds`
  * `kv_request_duration_seconds`
  * `operation_duration_seconds`
* [ENHANCEMENT] Add `outcome` label to `gate_duration_seconds` metric. Possible values are `rejected_canceled`, `rejected_deadline_exceeded`, `rejected_other`, and `permitted`. #512
* [ENHANCEMENT] Expose `InstancesWithTokensCount` and `InstancesWithTokensInZoneCount` in `ring.ReadRing` interface. #516
* [ENHANCEMENT] Middleware: determine route name in a single place, and add `middleware.ExtractRouteName()` method to allow consuming applications to retrieve the route name. #527
* [ENHANCEMENT] SpanProfiler: do less work on unsampled traces. #528
* [ENHANCEMENT] Log Middleware: if the trace is not sampled, log its ID as `trace_id_unsampled` instead of `trace_id`. #529
* [EHNANCEMENT] httpgrpc: httpgrpc Server can now use error message from special HTTP header when converting HTTP response to an error. This is useful when HTTP response body contains binary data that doesn't form valid utf-8 string, otherwise grpc would fail to marshal returned error. #531

* [BUGFIX] Correctly format `host:port` addresses when using IPv6. #388
* [BUGFIX] Memberlist's TCP transport will now reject bind addresses that are not IP addresses, such as "localhost", rather than silently converting these to 0.0.0.0 and therefore listening on all addresses. #396
* [BUGFIX] Ring: use zone-aware logging when all zones are required for quorum. #403
* [BUGFIX] Services: moduleService could drop stop signals to its underlying service. #409 #417
* [BUGFIX] ring: don't mark trace spans as failed if `DoUntilQuorum` terminates due to cancellation. #449
